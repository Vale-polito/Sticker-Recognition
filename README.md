# Tire Sticker Recognition

Tire Sticker Recognition is an Android app aiming at scanning tire stickers on cars and automatically extracting information with OCR ([Optical Caracter Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)).
It automatically recognizes specific text through the user's camera and parses it to retrieve relevant information from [Simple Tire](https://simpletire.com/)'s website.

## Dependencies

This app relies on [Google's Mobile Vision API](https://developers.google.com/vision/android/getting-started), and on [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/).

## Further Developments

Some sticker formats are not supported by the app. It could be interesting to improve the recognition algorithm to make it compatible with any type of sticker (requires benchmark of sticker types). 
Other features could also be added, or the app could be integrated in a bigger project.
